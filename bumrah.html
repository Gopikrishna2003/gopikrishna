    <p>Early life:</p>
    <p>Bumrah was born on 6 December 1993 into a Sikh Punjabi family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.His father, Jasbir Singh, ran a chemical business, while his mother, Daljeet Bumrah, worked as a school teacher. His father passed away when Bumrah was 5 years old due to hepatitis B.His mother raised him and his sister Juhika in a middle-class environment in Ahmedabad. Bumrah attended Nirman High School in Vastrapur, Ahmedabad, where his mother worked as the vice principal. He also played cricket for Nirman's team.</p>
    <p>Youth and domestic career:</p>
    <p>In 2010, Bumrah appeared at the Gujarat Cricket Association's Under-19 district selection trials. The selectors did not include him in the main squad of 15 due to his unconventional bowling action but named him as a reserve. After the district team won the first three matches, all three reserve players were given a chance in the fourth three-day match. Bumrah took seven wickets in that match.

        Bumrah made his twenty20 (T20) debut for Gujarat against Maharashtra in the 2012–13 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, and helped his side clinch the title with his Man of the Match performance in the final, with figures of 3/14 to beat Punjab.On 18 March 2013, during the match against Mumbai, former India coach John Wright, who was then the head coach of Mumbai Indians (MI) and scouting for the team at the time, was impressed by Bumrah's performance and invited him to sign up for MI.
        
        Bumrah played first-class cricket for Gujarat and made his debut against Vidarbha in October 2013 during the 2013–14 season, where he took seven wickets for 89 runs.During the 2015–16 Vijay Hazare Trophy, after the first two matches, the umpires called him for throwing and raised objections about his bowling action. The issue was resolved when the team management protested against it.Gujarat won the trophy, with Bumrah taking a five-wicket haul in the final against Delhi.On 11 December 2020, he scored his maiden first-class half century (55 not out) against Australia A during the India tour of Australia.</p>
    <p>International career:</p>
    <p>Bumrah made his ODI debut in January 2016 against Australia in the last match of the ODI series, where he took his first international wicket that of Steve Smith and finished with figures of 2/40.In the first match of the T20I series that followed Bumrah made his debut, taking his maiden T20I wicket  that of David Warner  and finished with figures of 3/23. India won the T20I series and Bumrah was the highest wicket-taker on either side with six wickets.In February 2016, he took three wickets in the T20I series against Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>Bumrah was named in India's 15-man squad for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20. He took a wicket in every single match of the tournament except against Bangladesh. In the semi-final against West Indies he took the wicket of Chris Gayle while conceding 42 runs, having an economy rate of 10.50 runs per over.India lost the match, and Bumrah finished the tournament with four wickets at an average of 38.25 and an economy rate of 7.65</p>
    <p>In January 2017, in the second match of the T20I series during England's 2016–17 tour of India, Bumrah picked up two wickets, conceded 20 runs, and was awarded the Player of the Match. He emerged as the second leading wicket-taker of the series, with five wickets in a 2–1 victory.In the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, he went wicketless in the first two matches of the tournament. India lost the final against Pakistan, and Bumrah finished the tournament as the second leading wicket-taker for India, after Bhuvneshwar Kumar.During the 2017 Sri Lanka tour, Bumrah recorded the most wickets (15) taken by any fast bowler in a bilateral ODI series of five or fewer matches.In February 2018, he became the highest-ranked bowler in the ICC Men's ODI player rankings, along with Afghanistani leg-spinner Rashid Khan.</p>
    <p>2018–2019: Test debut and World Cup:</p>
    <p>In November 2017, Bumrah was named in India's Test squad for their series against South Africa.He made his Test debut for India against South Africa at Newlands in Cape Town on 5 January 2018.In the third match of the series, at Johannesburg, Bumrah took his maiden five-wicket haul in Tests, with the figures of 5/54 from 18.5 overs.South Africa won the series 2–1. Bumrah was the second highest wicket-taker for India behind teammate Mohammed Shami.</p>
    <p>Bowling style:</p>
    <p>Bumrah gained prominence with his unorthodox action, and hyperextended elbows.His run-up is short, the first part of which consists of small, stuttering strides. He has an anomalous, stiff-armed action yet generates high pace, and his unusual point of release makes it difficult for the batsmen to read his bowling. Accordingly, the Indian team often uses him in powerplay and death overs.He bowls outside the off-stump, yorkers and short length balls frequently.According to former international bowler Shoaib Akhtar, Bumrah's bowling action has the potential to cause back injuries. Bumrah's front-on bowling action means that bowlers like him generate speed primarily from their shoulders and back, increasing the risk of injury.</p>
